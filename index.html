<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p><em>We present a novel sparse modeling approach to non-rigid shape matching using only the ability to detect repeat-
able regions. As the input to our algorithm, we are given only two sets of regions in two shapes; no descriptors
are provided so the correspondence between the regions is not know, nor we know how many regions correspond
in the two shapes. We show that even with such scarce information, it is possible to establish very accurate corre-
spondence between the shapes by using methods from the field of sparse modeling, being this, the first non-trivial
use of sparse models in shape correspondence. We formulate the problem of permuted sparse coding, in which
we solve simultaneously for an unknown permutation ordering the regions on two shapes and for an unknown
correspondence in functional representation. We also propose a robust variant capable of handling incomplete
matches. Numerically, the problem is solved efficiently by alternating the solution of a linear assignment and a
sparse coding problem. The proposed methods are evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively on standard bench-
marks containing both synthetic and scanned objects.</em></p>
