As the input to our algorithm, we are given only two sets of regions in two shapes; no descriptors\r\nare provided so the correspondence between the regions is not know, nor we know how many regions correspond\r\nin the two shapes. We show that even with such scarce information, it is possible to establish very accurate corre-\r\nspondence between the shapes by using methods from the field of sparse modeling, being this, the first non-trivial\r\nuse of sparse models in shape correspondence. We formulate the problem of permuted sparse coding, in which\r\nwe solve simultaneously for an unknown permutation ordering the regions on two shapes and for an unknown\r\ncorrespondence in functional representation. We also propose a robust variant capable of handling incomplete\r\nmatches. Numerically, the problem is solved efficiently by alternating the solution of a linear assignment and a\r\nsparse coding problem. The proposed methods are evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively on standard bench-\r\nmarks containing both synthetic and scanned objects.*\r\n\r\n[Sparse Modeling of Intrinsic Correspondences]()  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _Jonathan Pokrass, Alexander Bronstein, Michael Bronstein, Guillermo Sapiro, Pablo Sprechmann_\r\n\r\n","google":"","tagline":"Code for the Permuted Sparse Coding article from EG2013"}
